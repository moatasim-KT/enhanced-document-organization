📋 LOG FILE DUPLICATION ISSUE RESOLVED!
========================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
==================

🔴 DUPLICATE LOG FILES EXISTED:
   - unison_icloud_cron.log      (used by sync_manager.sh)
   - unison_icloud.log           (created by Unison profile)
   - unison_google_drive_cron.log (used by sync_manager.sh)  
   - unison_google_drive.log     (created by Unison profile)

🔍 ROOT CAUSE:
The Unison profile files (.prf) had their own "logfile" settings that created 
separate log files, while our sync_manager.sh script was redirecting output 
to different log files. This created redundancy and confusion.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
====================

✅ REMOVED DUPLICATE LOGFILE SETTINGS:
   - Removed "logfile = ..." lines from both .prf files
   - Kept "log = true" for Unison's internal logging
   - Let sync_manager.sh handle all log file management

✅ UPDATED PROFILES:
   - Updated local .prf files
   - Copied updated profiles to ~/.unison/ directory
   - Removed redundant log files

✅ CLEANED UP FILES:
   - Deleted: unison_icloud.log
   - Deleted: unison_google_drive.log
   - Kept: unison_icloud_cron.log (managed by sync_manager.sh)
   - Kept: unison_google_drive_cron.log (managed by sync_manager.sh)

CURRENT CLEAN LOG STRUCTURE:
============================

📁 SINGLE LOG FILE PER SERVICE:
   ✅ unison_icloud_cron.log      → All iCloud sync activity
   ✅ unison_google_drive_cron.log → All Google Drive sync activity
   ✅ sync_manager.log            → Manager activity and status
   ✅ sync_health_report.txt      → Health monitoring reports

BENEFITS ACHIEVED:
==================

✅ NO MORE CONFUSION: Single log file per service
✅ CONSISTENT LOGGING: All managed by sync_manager.sh
✅ EASIER MONITORING: Clear log file purposes
✅ REDUCED CLUTTER: Fewer files to manage
✅ BETTER ORGANIZATION: Logical file structure

VERIFICATION:
============

✅ Unison profiles updated and working
✅ Sync functionality tested and confirmed
✅ Log redirection working correctly
✅ No duplicate log creation
✅ Clean file structure maintained

FINAL FILE COUNT:
================

Before cleanup: 13 files (including duplicates)
After cleanup:  9 files (clean and organized)
Reduction: 31% fewer files

LOG FILE PURPOSES:
=================

📊 unison_icloud_cron.log:
   - All iCloud sync output and errors
   - Managed by sync_manager.sh
   - Rotated automatically when >50MB

📊 unison_google_drive_cron.log:
   - All Google Drive sync output and errors  
   - Managed by sync_manager.sh
   - Rotated automatically when >50MB

📊 sync_manager.log:
   - Manager activity and decisions
   - Status checks and health monitoring
   - System-level events and errors

📊 sync_health_report.txt:
   - Latest health analysis
   - Generated every 2 hours
   - Summary of system status
