# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the comprehensive optimization of the Enhanced Document Organization System. The project has grown organically over time, resulting in redundant files, scattered documentation, and inconsistent implementations. This optimization will transform the system into a clean, well-documented, and highly functional solution while preserving all core capabilities and adding valuable enhancements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want to remove all redundant and obsolete files, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify all redundant files and folders
2. WHEN removing redundant files THEN the system SHALL preserve all essential functionality
3. WHEN cleaning up the archive_old_files directory THEN the system SHALL remove all obsolete backup files
4. WHEN consolidating scripts THEN the system SHALL eliminate duplicate functionality
5. WHEN removing temporary analysis files THEN the system SHALL clean up the .reports directory
6. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL have reduced file count by at least 40%

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all project information consolidated into a single comprehensive README.md, so that I can understand and use the system from one authoritative source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the consolidated README THEN the system SHALL include complete project overview and architecture
2. WHEN documenting setup instructions THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step installation and configuration
3. WHEN documenting usage THEN the system SHALL include all command examples and workflows
4. WHEN documenting features THEN the system SHALL explain all capabilities including AI integration
5. WHEN consolidating documentation THEN the system SHALL remove all other markdown files
6. WHEN the documentation is complete THEN users SHALL be able to set up and use the system using only the README

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all core functionality thoroughly tested, so that I can be confident the system works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the organize module THEN the system SHALL verify document categorization works correctly
2. WHEN testing the sync module THEN the system SHALL verify cloud synchronization functions properly
3. WHEN testing the MCP server THEN the system SHALL verify AI integration works with Claude
4. WHEN testing automation THEN the system SHALL verify scheduled operations execute correctly
5. WHEN testing error handling THEN the system SHALL verify circuit breakers and retry logic work
6. WHEN testing is complete THEN all core workflows SHALL pass automated tests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system optimized for performance and reliability, so that it runs efficiently and handles errors gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizing the codebase THEN the system SHALL eliminate redundant code paths
2. WHEN improving error handling THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
3. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL reduce resource usage by at least 20%
4. WHEN enhancing reliability THEN the system SHALL improve sync success rates
5. WHEN streamlining operations THEN the system SHALL reduce average processing time
6. WHEN optimization is complete THEN the system SHALL demonstrate improved performance metrics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a power user, I want enhanced features and capabilities, so that I can get more value from the document organization system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN proposing new features THEN the system SHALL identify at least 5 valuable enhancements
2. WHEN enhancing AI integration THEN the system SHALL improve context awareness and capabilities
3. WHEN adding monitoring features THEN the system SHALL provide better visibility into system health
4. WHEN improving user experience THEN the system SHALL simplify common operations
5. WHEN adding analytics THEN the system SHALL provide insights into usage patterns
6. WHEN enhancements are complete THEN users SHALL have access to significantly improved functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive validation of all system components, so that I can ensure everything works together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating the main entry point THEN the system SHALL verify drive_sync.sh works with all modules
2. WHEN validating configuration THEN the system SHALL verify all config files are properly formatted
3. WHEN validating automation THEN the system SHALL verify LaunchAgent scheduling works correctly
4. WHEN validating sync profiles THEN the system SHALL verify Unison profiles are configured properly
5. WHEN validating MCP integration THEN the system SHALL verify Claude Desktop integration works
6. WHEN validation is complete THEN all system components SHALL work together seamlessly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase structure optimized and standardized, so that future maintenance and enhancements are easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN restructuring the codebase THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
2. WHEN organizing modules THEN the system SHALL ensure clear separation of concerns
3. WHEN standardizing scripts THEN the system SHALL use consistent error handling patterns
4. WHEN optimizing configuration THEN the system SHALL consolidate related settings
5. WHEN improving code quality THEN the system SHALL eliminate shell script anti-patterns
6. WHEN restructuring is complete THEN the codebase SHALL be significantly more maintainable
