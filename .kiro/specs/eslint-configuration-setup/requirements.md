# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The project currently lacks a proper ESLint configuration, preventing automated code quality and style checking. This feature will establish a comprehensive ESLint setup that enables static code analysis for all JavaScript files in the project, following modern JavaScript (ESM) practices for a Node.js environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ESLint to run without configuration errors, so that I can perform automated code quality checks on the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint is executed in the project root THEN the system SHALL NOT display "No ESLint configuration found" error
2. WHEN ESLint runs THEN the system SHALL successfully analyze JavaScript files without configuration-related failures
3. WHEN ESLint configuration is present THEN the system SHALL use modern JavaScript (ESM) standards for Node.js environment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ESLint to analyze all relevant JavaScript files in the project, so that code quality issues are detected across the entire codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint runs THEN the system SHALL analyze JavaScript files in the `src/` directory
2. WHEN ESLint runs THEN the system SHALL analyze JavaScript files in the `test/` directory
3. WHEN ESLint runs THEN the system SHALL analyze configuration files like `eslint.config.js`
4. WHEN ESLint encounters `node_modules/` directories THEN the system SHALL exclude them from analysis
5. WHEN ESLint encounters log files THEN the system SHALL exclude them from analysis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ESLint rules to follow modern JavaScript best practices, so that the code maintains high quality and consistency standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL enforce ES2022+ syntax rules
2. WHEN ESLint configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL support ESM (import/export) syntax
3. WHEN ESLint configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL include Node.js environment globals
4. WHEN ESLint configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent code formatting rules
5. WHEN ESLint configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL detect potential runtime errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ESLint to integrate with the existing project structure, so that it works seamlessly with current development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint configuration is created THEN the system SHALL be compatible with the existing `package.json` setup
2. WHEN ESLint runs THEN the system SHALL respect existing `.gitignore` patterns for file exclusion
3. WHEN ESLint configuration is established THEN the system SHALL allow for future customization and rule additions
4. WHEN ESLint runs THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages for any violations found
