# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Document Organization System has four critical bugs that prevent it from functioning correctly. These issues cause the system to create files in wrong locations, fail to load configurations, and perform poorly during organization. This spec addresses these specific technical problems to restore proper system functionality.

### Identified Issues

**Issue 1: Incorrect Sync Hub Path Creation**
- Problem: The content_consolidator.js module incorrectly constructs the path to the sync hub using the project's root directory and a hardcoded folder name (Sync_Hub_New) instead of using the SYNC_HUB path from config.env
- Impact: New folders appear inside the project directory instead of the configured sync location

**Issue 2: Wrong Organization Config File Path**
- Problem: The organize_module.sh script looks for organize_config.conf inside the src directory instead of the config directory
- Impact: Custom category configurations are not loaded or saved correctly

**Issue 3: Poor Organization Performance**
- Problem: The organize_module.sh script calls a Node.js script separately for every single file to determine its category
- Impact: Organization process is extremely slow, especially with many files

**Issue 4: Broken Argument Parsing and Dry-Run**
- Problem: Command-line argument handling in organize_module.sh is confusing and contains a bug that prevents dry-run from working correctly when run standalone
- Impact: Users cannot properly test the organization process before applying changes

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Correct Sync Hub Path Usage

**User Story:** As a user organizing documents, I want consolidated documents to be created in my configured sync hub location, so that they appear in the correct directory structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the content consolidator initializes THEN it SHALL receive the correct SYNC_HUB path from config.env
2. WHEN consolidated documents are created THEN they SHALL be placed in the configured SYNC_HUB directory, not in the project root
3. WHEN the content consolidator constructs paths THEN it SHALL use the provided SYNC_HUB path instead of hardcoded "Sync_Hub_New"
4. WHEN organize_module.sh calls content_consolidator THEN it SHALL pass the correct SYNC_HUB path as a parameter
5. WHEN the MCP server calls content consolidation THEN it SHALL provide the correct SYNC_HUB path from configuration
6. IF the SYNC_HUB path doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create the directory structure automatically

### Requirement 2: Correct Configuration File Path Resolution

**User Story:** As a user with custom category configurations, I want the organization system to read and write to the correct config file location, so that my custom settings are properly loaded and saved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organize_module.sh looks for organize_config.conf THEN it SHALL check the config directory, not the src directory
2. WHEN the category manager loads configuration THEN it SHALL use the path config/organize_config.conf
3. WHEN configuration is saved THEN it SHALL be written to config/organize_config.conf
4. IF the config file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it with default values in the config directory
5. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate that the config directory exists and is writable
6. WHEN custom categories are added THEN they SHALL be persisted to the correct config file location

### Requirement 3: Efficient Batch File Processing

**User Story:** As a user organizing many documents, I want the organization process to complete quickly, so that I don't have to wait for individual file processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organize_module.sh processes files THEN it SHALL make a single call to Node.js with all files to be organized
2. WHEN the Node.js categorization script runs THEN it SHALL process all files in one execution and return a complete organization plan
3. WHEN the bash script receives the organization plan THEN it SHALL execute all file moves efficiently
4. WHEN files are being categorized THEN the system SHALL avoid spawning separate Node.js processes for each file
5. IF the file list is very large THEN the system SHALL process files in reasonable batches to avoid memory issues
6. WHEN organization completes THEN the total processing time SHALL be significantly reduced compared to the current per-file approach

### Requirement 4: Reliable Argument Parsing and Dry-Run Functionality

**User Story:** As a user testing the organization system, I want dry-run mode to work correctly when running the script standalone, so that I can preview changes before applying them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organize_module.sh is called with dry-run argument THEN it SHALL correctly parse and apply the dry-run flag
2. WHEN the script runs in dry-run mode THEN it SHALL display what actions would be taken without executing them
3. WHEN argument parsing occurs THEN it SHALL handle both standalone execution and integration with the main system
4. WHEN the script is run standalone THEN all command-line arguments SHALL be processed correctly
5. IF invalid arguments are provided THEN the system SHALL display helpful usage information
6. WHEN dry-run mode is active THEN no files SHALL be moved or modified, only logged as intended actions

### Requirement 5: MCP Server Functionality and Stability

**User Story:** As a developer using AI assistants, I want the MCP server to work reliably with all its tools, so that I can interact with my documents through natural language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN it SHALL initialize without hanging or timing out
2. WHEN the MCP server receives tool requests THEN it SHALL respond with valid JSON according to the MCP protocol
3. WHEN MCP tools are called THEN all 14 defined tools SHALL work without throwing unhandled exceptions
4. WHEN the server encounters errors THEN it SHALL log them appropriately and return proper error responses
5. IF the server.js file has incomplete implementations THEN all missing function implementations SHALL be completed
6. WHEN the MCP server initializes paths THEN it SHALL use the correct SYNC_HUB path from configuration instead of hardcoded values

### Requirement 6: Module Integration and Import Resolution

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the shell scripts and Node.js modules to work together reliably, so that the document organization workflow completes successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shell scripts execute Node.js code THEN the ES module imports SHALL resolve correctly
2. WHEN the organize_module.sh script runs THEN it SHALL complete without module import errors
3. WHEN Node.js modules are imported dynamically THEN proper error handling SHALL catch and report import failures
4. WHEN the content analysis pipeline runs THEN it SHALL handle missing or invalid files gracefully
5. IF a Node.js module fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message and continue with fallback behavior
6. WHEN the system runs on different machines THEN all path references SHALL resolve correctly

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Logging Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can identify and fix problems quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component encounters an error THEN it SHALL log the error with sufficient context for debugging
2. WHEN async operations fail THEN the errors SHALL be properly caught and handled
3. WHEN the system runs in dry-run mode THEN it SHALL clearly indicate what actions would be taken
4. IF critical dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages
5. WHEN logging occurs THEN log levels SHALL be used appropriately (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
6. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL include stack traces and relevant context information
