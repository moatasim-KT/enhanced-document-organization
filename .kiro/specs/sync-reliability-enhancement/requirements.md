# Requirements for Sync Reliability Enhancement

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the reliability of the drive synchronization system. The goal is to create a robust system that can handle various failure scenarios gracefully, automatically recover from errors when possible, and provide clear diagnostics when manual intervention is needed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Error Classification and Handling

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the sync system to intelligently classify and handle different types of errors, so that appropriate recovery strategies can be applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sync operation fails THEN the system SHALL classify the error into one of the following categories: transient, authentication, conflict, quota, network, configuration, or permanent.
2. WHEN an error is classified THEN the system SHALL record the error type, severity, and context in a structured format.
3. WHEN multiple errors occur in sequence THEN the system SHALL detect patterns and escalate severity appropriately.
4. WHEN an error is classified as transient THEN the system SHALL automatically retry the operation with appropriate backoff.
5. WHEN an error is classified as permanent THEN the system SHALL alert the user and not attempt automatic recovery.

### Requirement 2: Adaptive Retry Strategy

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sync system to intelligently retry failed operations with appropriate timing and limits, so that temporary issues can be resolved automatically without overwhelming the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a retry is needed THEN the system SHALL use an adaptive strategy based on error type, attempt number, and historical success rates.
2. WHEN implementing exponential backoff THEN the system SHALL include appropriate jitter to prevent thundering herd problems.
3. WHEN retrying quota-related errors THEN the system SHALL respect service-specific rate limits and quota reset times.
4. WHEN maximum retry attempts are reached THEN the system SHALL escalate to a higher-level recovery mechanism or alert the user.
5. WHEN retries consistently fail THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent resource exhaustion.

### Requirement 3: Failure Context Tracking

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the sync system to maintain context about failures over time, so that patterns can be detected and more intelligent recovery decisions can be made.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL record detailed context including timestamps, error types, and affected resources.
2. WHEN tracking failures THEN the system SHALL maintain a sliding window of recent failures for pattern detection.
3. WHEN similar failures occur repeatedly THEN the system SHALL recognize the pattern and adjust recovery strategies accordingly.
4. WHEN failure patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL provide actionable insights in monitoring reports.
5. WHEN failure context is stored THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate data retention and cleanup policies.

### Requirement 4: Circuit Breaker Implementation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the sync system to implement circuit breaker patterns, so that cascading failures can be prevented during persistent error conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consecutive failures exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL "open the circuit" to prevent further attempts.
2. WHEN a circuit is open THEN the system SHALL periodically attempt recovery with a "half-open" state.
3. WHEN a successful operation occurs in "half-open" state THEN the system SHALL close the circuit and resume normal operation.
4. WHEN implementing circuit breakers THEN the system SHALL use different thresholds and recovery times based on error types.
5. WHEN a circuit remains open for an extended period THEN the system SHALL alert administrators for manual intervention.

### Requirement 5: Automated Recovery Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sync system to automatically recover from common error conditions, so that manual intervention is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt to refresh credentials or tokens automatically.
2. WHEN file conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent merge strategies or create backups of conflicted files.
3. WHEN disk space issues occur THEN the system SHALL attempt to clean up temporary files and logs.
4. WHEN configuration errors are detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to restore default configurations.
5. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL wait for connectivity and resume operations automatically.

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed logs and monitoring of sync operations and recovery attempts, so that I can diagnose issues and improve reliability over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any sync operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the operation, including performance metrics.
2. WHEN recovery actions are attempted THEN the system SHALL log the action, context, and outcome.
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces where applicable.
4. WHEN logs are generated THEN the system SHALL include correlation IDs to track related operations.
5. WHEN monitoring data is collected THEN the system SHALL generate periodic reports on reliability metrics.

### Requirement 7: Health Check and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sync system to provide health checks and diagnostics, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL perform a comprehensive health check of all sync components.
2. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity, permissions, and configuration.
3. WHEN health issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable remediation steps.
4. WHEN diagnostics are requested THEN the system SHALL collect relevant logs and metrics for troubleshooting.
5. WHEN persistent issues occur THEN the system SHALL suggest advanced diagnostic procedures.

### Requirement 8: Self-Healing Capabilities

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the sync system to implement self-healing mechanisms, so that common issues can be resolved without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN archive corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically reset and rebuild archives.
2. WHEN permission issues are detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to fix permissions automatically.
3. WHEN temporary files accumulate THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup procedures.
4. WHEN network paths change THEN the system SHALL attempt to rediscover and reconnect.
5. WHEN self-healing actions are taken THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the actions and outcomes.
