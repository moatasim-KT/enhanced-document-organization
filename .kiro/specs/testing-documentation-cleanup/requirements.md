# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the testing infrastructure, documentation quality, and codebase cleanliness of the document organization system. The goal is to ensure the consolidated modules are thoroughly tested, well-documented, and the codebase is free of redundant files. This will improve maintainability, reliability, and ease of use for the document organization system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the document organization system, I want comprehensive test coverage for the new consolidated structure, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite is executed THEN the system SHALL test all consolidated modules with appropriate test cases
2. WHEN new consolidated modules are added THEN the system SHALL include corresponding test scripts that validate their functionality
3. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL provide clear pass/fail feedback for each module tested
4. WHEN integration points between modules are tested THEN the system SHALL verify that modules work correctly together

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with the document organization system, I want updated test scripts that work with the new structure, so that I can validate system functionality after changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing test scripts are executed THEN the system SHALL work with the current consolidated module structure
2. WHEN test scripts reference file paths THEN the system SHALL use correct paths that match the new organization
3. WHEN test scripts are run THEN the system SHALL not fail due to outdated references to old script locations
4. WHEN test configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL use current configuration files and settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new developer or user of the document organization system, I want comprehensive inline documentation, so that I can understand how each script and module works without external resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reads any script file THEN the system SHALL provide clear inline comments explaining the purpose and functionality
2. WHEN a function or module is encountered THEN the system SHALL include documentation describing parameters, return values, and usage
3. WHEN complex logic is implemented THEN the system SHALL include explanatory comments for non-obvious code sections
4. WHEN configuration options are available THEN the system SHALL document what each option does and how to use it

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the document organization system, I want detailed usage examples, so that I can quickly understand how to use the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to understand system usage THEN the system SHALL provide practical examples showing common use cases
2. WHEN configuration is required THEN the system SHALL include example configurations with explanations
3. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide examples of common issues and their solutions
4. WHEN advanced features are available THEN the system SHALL include examples demonstrating their usage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the document organization system, I want a clean codebase free of redundant files, so that the system is easier to maintain and understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup process is complete THEN the system SHALL have removed all original scripts that have been replaced by consolidated modules
2. WHEN redundant files are identified THEN the system SHALL safely archive or remove them without affecting functionality
3. WHEN the new structure is fully tested THEN the system SHALL only retain files that serve a current purpose
4. WHEN cleanup is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain a record of what was removed for potential recovery needs
