# Codebase Reorganization Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Created Modular Directory Structure**
   - `sync/`: Contains consolidated sync functionality
   - `organize/`: Contains consolidated organization functionality
   - `mcp/`: Contains MCP server and management scripts
   - `tests/`: Contains all test scripts

2. **Consolidated Scripts**
   - Created `sync_module.sh` by combining:
     - `sync_manager.sh`
     - `sync_reliability_enhanced.sh`
     - `circuit_breaker.sh`
   
   - Created `organize_module.sh` as a simplified version of:
     - `organize_documents_enhanced.sh`
     - `organize_manager.sh`
     - `simplified_categorization.sh`
   
   - Created `mcp_manager.sh` to manage the MCP server

3. **Created Main Entry Point**
   - Added `drive_sync.sh` as the main entry point script
   - Provides a unified interface to all modules
   - Supports running the complete workflow with a single command

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Completely rewrote the README.md file
   - Added clear usage instructions for the new structure
   - Documented the modular architecture

5. **Moved Test Scripts**
   - Moved all test scripts to the `tests/` directory
   - Removed redundant test scripts

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Each module has a clear responsibility
   - Easier to understand and modify individual components
   - Reduced code duplication

2. **Simplified Usage**
   - Single entry point for all operations
   - Consistent command structure
   - Better help documentation

3. **Better Organization**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Logical grouping of related functionality
   - Easier to find specific components

4. **Reduced Clutter**
   - Removed redundant scripts
   - Consolidated similar functionality
   - Organized tests in a dedicated directory

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Implementation**
   - Finish implementing the functionality in `organize_module.sh`
   - Ensure all features from the original scripts are preserved

2. **Testing**
   - Update test scripts to work with the new structure
   - Add tests for the consolidated modules

3. **Documentation**
   - Add inline documentation to the scripts
   - Create more detailed usage examples

4. **Cleanup**
   - Remove the original scripts once the new structure is fully tested
   - Archive any remaining redundant file
